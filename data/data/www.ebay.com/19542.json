Users have an instantly clear view of their programs instead of time-consuming switching between programs or document windows with overly crowded desktop space and limited viewing. By performing fast reactions to multiple information sources, DoubleSight users can experience significant productivity increases ranging from approximately 20 to 50 percent by easily managing their multiple programs simultaneously. Unlike large-screen monitors that often sacrifice legibility to offer more desktop space under a high resolution, the DoubleSight dual LCD monitor can effectively provide large desktop space in a legible format.",
