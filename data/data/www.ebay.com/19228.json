The LCD display is built into the cover; the keyboard and touchpad are built into the base. Setup is fast and easy. There is no software to configure, no installation routines, and no incompatibility problems. Slide the console module section out; flip the cover up; and you are ready to go to work. When finished, flip the cover down and slide the console module away back into the rack. There is no better way to save time and money than with a CL1000M installation. Just connect the cable between CL1000M and a KVM or a computer, and the CL 1000M is ready to serve you.",
