    "description": "Utilising the latest technology panels, the new Philips displays are designed with a minimalistic approach by limiting the outer bezel thickness to about 2.5 mm. Combined with an in-panel black matrix strip of around 9 mm, the overall bezel dimensions are reduced significantly, minimising distractions and maximising viewing size. Especially suited to multi-display or tiling setups like gaming, graphics design and professional applications, the Ultra-narrow bezel display gives you the feeling of using one large display. The Philips gaming display has quick-access OSD fine-tuned for gamers, offering you multiple options. FPS mode (First person shooting) improves dark themes in games, allowing you to see hidden objects in dark areas. Racing mode adapts the display with the fastest response time and high colour, along with image adjustments. RTS mode (Real-time strategy) has a special SmartFrame mode that enables highlighting of specific area and allows for size and image adjustments. Gamer 1 and Gamer 2 enable you to save personal customised settings based on different games, ensuring best performance.",
