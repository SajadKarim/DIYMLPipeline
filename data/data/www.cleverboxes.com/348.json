    "description": "PowerSensor is a built-in 'people sensor' that transmits and receives harmless infrared signals to determine if the user is present and then automatically reduces monitor brightness when then user steps away from the desk, cutting energy costs by up to 80 percent and prolonging monitor life. Embedded 2 megapixel webcam with superb, bright and crisp images enables you to socialise with your family and friends. Its sensitive microphone ensures that your voice carries through clearly. You can hear clear audio either from its built-in stereo speakers, or attach your own headphones for private conversations.

With the ultra high resolution Philips MultiView display you can now experience a world of connectivity in comfort whether at the office or at home.
