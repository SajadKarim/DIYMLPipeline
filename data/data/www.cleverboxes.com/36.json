    "description": "PC software for fine tuning display performance and settings. Philips offers users two choices for display setting adjustment. Either navigate the multi-level On-Screen Display menu through buttons on the display itself or use the Philips SmartControl software to easily adjust the various display settings in a familiar way. SmartContrast is a Philips technology that analyses the contents you are displaying, automatically adjusting colours and controlling backlight intensity to dynamically enhance contrast for the best digital images and videos or when playing games where dark hues are displayed. When Economy mode is selected, contrast is adjusted and backlighting fine-tuned for just-right display of everyday office applications and lower power consumption. Touch controls are intelligent, touch sensitive icons that replace protruding buttons that lets the user adjust the monitor to their requirement. Responding to your lightest touch, Touch control gives the monitor a modern feel. TrueVision is a proprietary Philips technology that uses an advanced algorithm for testing and aligning the monitor display, which gives you the ultimate display performance 4 times more stringent than Windows sRGB requirements. Only Philips ensures each and every monitor that leaves the factory is fine tuned with this process so you can get consistent colour and picture quality.",
