Your eyes may not see flickers, but can certainly feel them. Free your eyes from flickers by switching to Flicker-free Monitors and let your eyes do less work.

Switch to one of the four preset Low Blue Light Modes from OSD hot key (Multimedia - 30% reduction, Web-surfing - 50% reduction, Office - 60% reduction, Reading - 70% reduction), and reward your eyes without having to lose the visual enjoyment.
