    "description": "The Full HD screen has the widescreen resolution of 1920 x 1080p. This is the highest resolution of HD sources for the best possible picture quality. It is fully future-proof as it supports 1080p signals from all sources, including the most recent sources such as Bluray and advanced HD game consoles. The signal processing is extensively upgraded to support this much higher signal quality and resolution. It produces brilliant flicker-free progressive scan pictures with superb brightness and colours. TrueVision is a proprietary Philips technology that uses an advanced algorithm for testing and aligning the monitor display, which gives you the ultimate display performance 4 times more stringent than Windows sRGB requirements. Only Philips ensures each and every monitor that leaves the factory is fine tuned with this process so you can get consistent colour and picture quality.",
