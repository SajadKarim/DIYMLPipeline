    "description": "With true 1920 x 1080p resolution this LFD is ready to display high definition images. This means it can accommodate more information on the screen; e.g. 60% more in comparison to a 1280 x 1024 monitor. IPS panel technology technology offers higher contrast, darker blacks and much better viewing angles than standard TN technology. The screen will look good no matter what angle you look at it. PIP (Picture in Picture) function allows you to watch images coming from two different sources at the same time. VESA mount compliance means you can easily mount the LFD to any mounting that complies with the VESA standard. The ambient light sensor detects changes in environmental lighting conditions and automatically adjusts the screens backlight brightness to compensate for and increase or decrease in light. A wide range of video inputs assures compatibility with multiple platforms. Built-in stereo speakers deliver rich sound. For ease of control a remote control is supplied with the LFD. You can easily lock and unlock the controls preventing unauthorised changes to settings you made. The IPC Space at the back of the panel allows you to mount a small PC or a media player to the LFD.",
