    "description": "This allows the LFD to operate efficiently and consistently over longer periods of time without costly servicing and maintenance. And you can be sure the quality of your message won't be compromised from extended usage. Built with industry leading imaging technology, Samsung outdoor series produce images that are more vibrant and realistic than any other large format display in its class. Because LCD panels use a polarised film, passers-by wearing sunglasses also coated in a polarised film can't always see what was being displayed on the screen. The two polarised films cancelled each other out. But now Samsung have developed another panel coating that overcomes this problem - allowing everybody to see your message clearly. The Samsung Outdoor series features an upgraded Multi Display Control solution that lets you control a large number of displays through their embedded RS232 and RJ45 interfaces. Easy and intuitive to use, you can control displays over short and long distances. Maximise impact with a great picture twinned with ultra-crisp audio. The powerful built-in speakers will allow your message to be heard loud and clear while saving you the cost and space of having to purchase and install separate speakers. Keep your display running efficiently at all times. This Samsung LFD boasts a smart scheduling feature.",
