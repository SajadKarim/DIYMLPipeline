    "description": "Basic safety, essential performance and reliability are essential requirements in a professional clinical environment. Unlike standard displays, Philips clinical review displays employ special medical-grade power supplies in order to meet these requirements. It complies with the EN/IEC 60601-1 standard ensuring basic safety and essential performance. It also complies with the EN/IEC 60601-1-2 collateral standard for medical-grade electromagnetic tests and compatibility. Many countries, hospitals and clinics mandate compliance to these standards as a requirement. IPS displays use an advanced technology that gives you extra wide viewing angles of 178/178 degrees, making it possible to view the display from almost any angle-even in 90 degree Pivot mode! Unlike standard TN panels, IPS displays gives you remarkably crisp images with vivid colours, making it ideal not only for Photos, movies and web browsing, but also for professional applications, which demand colour accuracy and consistent brightness at all times. PowerSensor is a built-in 'people sensor' that transmits and receives harmless infrared signals to determine if the user is present and then automatically reduces monitor brightness when then user steps away from the desk, cutting energy costs by up to 80 percent and prolonging monitor life.",
