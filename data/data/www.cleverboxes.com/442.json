    "description": "Each PA279Q also features a brightness rated at 350cd/m2 and an 100,000,000:1 ASUS Smart Contrast Ratio for enhanced image contrast. The PA279Q WQHD monitor provides 109 pixels per inch (PPI), resulting in high quality 2560 x 1440 visuals - equaling four times the resolution of stand 720p sets. It allows users to view greater image detail and do more with an onscreen footprint larger than that of standard displays. The screen's 109PPI density means there are 109 RGB matrices within one inch. Generally, the more pixels a display has, the more lighting (or power) those pixels require to achieve the best visuals. However, with advanced LED backlighting on the PA279Q, power and energy savings are no longer compromised, while better visuals are assured. With its WQHD display, you enjoy 77% more desktop space than a full HD screen to spread out your windows and palettes. It is also about 25% sharper than a generic 27' full HD display, delivering ultra-smooth visuals thanks to 6ms (GTG) response time. This ensures you get lag-free experiences in movies and gaming, with the latter looking more vivid, with all in-game details shown in true colour. The ASUS PA279Q is undoubtedly your best choice for work and play.",
