    "description": "However, with advanced LED backlighting on the PB278Q, power and energy savings are no longer compromised, while better visuals are assured. The ASUS PB278Q provides an ultra-wide 178\u00b0 viewing angle on both horizontal and vertical planes, thereby minimizing onscreen colour shift even when viewed from extreme angles. With its WQHD display, you enjoy 77% more desktop space than a full HD screen to spread out your windows and palettes. It is also about 25% sharper than a generic 27' full HD display, delivering ultra-smooth visuals thanks to 5ms (GTG) response time. This ensures you get lag-free experiences in movies and gaming, with the latter looking more vivid, with all in-game details shown in true colour. The ASUS PB278Q is undoubtedly your best choice for work and play. The PB278Q features a host of connectivity options that include HDMI 1.4, DisplayPort 1.2, and dual-link DVI for native WQHD, plus D-sub for full HD 1080p content transmission. Twin built-in 3W speakers provide quality audio for a completely immersive home theater experience. With 80,000,000:1 ASUS Smart Contrast Ratio (ASCR) and 300cd/m2 brightness, the PB278Q enhances display contrast and sharpness by adjusting backlight luminance to achieve the deepest black tones and brightest whites, resulting in extra-clear visuals that truly come to life.",
