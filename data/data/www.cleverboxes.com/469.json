    "description": "AH-IPS is the latest in IPS technology - delivering improved colour accuracy plus increased energy efficiency. Tracer Free Technology improves the response time of ASUS monitors, eliminating ghosting and tracers during video playback. It does this by controlling voltage levels, resulting in 5ms response time so MX279H provides fluid and clear video playback with silky-smooth motion during gameplay. With ASUS Smart Contrast Ratio (ASCR) of 80,000,000:1 and 250cd/m2 brightness, MX279H augments display contrast and sharpness by adjusting backlighting luminance to achieve the deepest blacks and brightest whites for truly lifelike visuals. ASUS includes its exclusive QuickFit Virtual Scale feature with the MX279H, allowing you to preview photos and documents on-screen in their actual size prior to printing. It can be activated via a monitor hotkey, and serves as a highly useful guide to accurately view and edit photos in their native size.",
