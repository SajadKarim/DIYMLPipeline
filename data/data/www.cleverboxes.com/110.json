    "description": "You'll find the Samsung LED LFD brings with it a slim bezel and light design, yet it offers heavy weight communication solutions for any modern business looking to convey concise marketing or educational messages. Its sheer narrowness of bezel removes any distractions from your sight to provide a greater surface area. Whilst its lightness makes it easy to transport and mount. In your day-to-day work it's a constant challenge to make sure your sales or educational messages are noticed quickly with maximum impact. With the built-in media player for your Samsung LFD, you can elevate your display capabilities more than you ever thought possible. The brightness sensor detects the ambient light intensity and automatically adjusts the screen brightness in accordance. The inclusion of our Samsung MagicInfo Lite software enables you to run the LFD as a standalone unit without the need of additional players, display and schedule video clip, slide show and image files increased versatility. Its features include Network Schedule, Network Schedule Manager, Local Schedule, Local Schedule Manager, Contents Manager, Internal AutoPlay and USB AutoPlay.",
