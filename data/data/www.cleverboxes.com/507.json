    "description": "HDMI stands for High-Definition Multimedia Interface. Much smaller and more convenient than DVI, HDMI also has the significant advantage over DVI that it supports audio as well as video signals. A typical CCFL LCD uses four backlight lamps. Using LED diodes considerably lowers the power consumption and reduces the CO2 emission into the environment making this LCD a true ECO-Friendly product. When very fast graphics are displayed your monitor can sometimes get blurry. Turning on the OverDrive feature will eliminate that. VESA mount compliance means you can easily mount your monitor to a wall. This LED monitor is equipped with two high quality stereo speakers.",
