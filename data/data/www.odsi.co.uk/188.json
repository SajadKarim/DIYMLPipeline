    "description technical detail": "NEC MultiSync V423 - 42\" LED-backlit LCD Flat Panel Display Monitor\nNEC's 42\" V423 high-performance large-screen display utilizes LED backlighting to deliver both environmental and functional benefits for digital signage. The V423's commercial-grade panel is capable of displaying brilliant imagery and capturing the audience's attention.\nThis Full HD model features built-in speakers and an Open Pluggable Specification (OPS)-compliant expansion slot, which future-proofs the display and allows for the seamless integration of a computer or other NEC/third-party component. Because video, RS-232 control and power are passed internally from the display to the computer, additional cabling is not required, thereby simplifying installations. With integrated temperature sensors and fans, this display is ideal in applications that require extended use, including retail stores, restaurants, indoor venues, training facilities and corporate boardrooms.",
