    "description technical detail": "NEC MultiSync EA224WMi - 22\" - LED-backlit LCD Monitor\nNEC's 22\" MultiSync EA224WMi uses a premium-grade IPS panel, which provides wide viewing angles, outstanding color consistency and image accuracy. Its LED backlighting technology allows a thinner, lighter and sleeker design, as well as higher power efficiency. This EPEAT Gold model includes DisplayPort, HDMI, DVI-D and VGA D-Sub inputs, as well as an integrated 4-port USB 2.0 hub to connects you to the latest peripherals.\nTouch-sensitive controls enable simple display adjustments through the EA224WMi's On Screen Display (OSD), while integrated smart sensing technology includes ambient light and human sensors to automatically determine the proper display brightness and detect the absence of the user, both of which reduce power consumption and prolong product life.",
