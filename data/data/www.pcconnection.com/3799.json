    "compatibility notes": "Lightweight Strength:\nMagConnect mounts are built of high-quality carbon fiber arms. This advanced material is surprisingly lightweight yet incredibly strong. The powerful combination of carbon fiber with carefully designed joints produces mounts that are both easy to maneuver and sturdy to use.\nSpherical Joints:\nMagConnect mounts come equipped with spherical joints for ultimate customizability. The included MagConnect iPad holder can be swiveled 360\u00b0 to easily transition from portrait to landscape mode without removing it from the mount. And the sturdy carbon fiber arms can also be adjusted into infinite configurations providing you with the perfect angle every time.\nMagnetic Personality:\nThe MagConnect locking mechanism is the next step in the evolution of mobile mounts. The technology is advanced, but using it is quite simple. First, the iPad is secured into a hard-shell case equipped with a powerful magnet. When the case is attached to a compatible product, another magnet instantly interlocks your MagConnect shell with a receiver, while a precision screw tightens for a secure fit.\nBeautiful On and Off its Pedestal:\nWhen your iPad is not mounted, you can carry it in style. The MagConnect hard-shell case is textured for stunning look and feel and comes complete with a low-profile cap to cover the magnetic connector. The included case is designed to work seamlessly the Apple Smart Cover, or for greater protection pair it with our Folio360 III, the most customizable iPad case anywhere.\nCompatible with: the new iPad (3rd Gen.) & iPad2.",
