    "compatibility notes": "Use the stand with a range of HP notebooks and docking stations, and up to a 24-inch diagonal display. Dependent on your docking station\u2019s ports, you can also connect peripherals for a total workspace solution.\nSimply snap the docking station into the tray, attach the display head to the VESA mount, and you\u2019re ready to work every time you dock your notebook.\nIf you prefer to work without a dock, you can park the notebook in the tray on its own. Use the cable routing feature to keep cables out of the way and create a clean working area.\nPosition the stand for the way you work best, with adjustable tilt and adjustable and lockable height, and 360-degree panning of the base so you can rotate your entire workspace.",
