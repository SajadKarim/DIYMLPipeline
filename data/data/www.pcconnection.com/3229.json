    "compatibility notes": "Lightweight Strength:\nMagConnect mounts are built of high-quality carbon fiber arms. This advanced material is surprisingly lightweight yet incredibly strong. The powerful combination of carbon fiber with carefully designed joints produces mounts that are both easy to maneuver and sturdy to use.\nSpherical Joints:\nMagConnect mounts come equipped with spherical joints for ultimate customizability. The included MagConnect iPad holder can be swiveled 360\u00b0 to easily transition from portrait to landscape mode without removing it from the mount. And the sturdy carbon fiber arms can also be adjusted into infinite configurations providing you with the perfect angle every time.\nMagnetic Personality:\nThe MagConnect locking mechanism is the next step in the evolution of mobile mounts. The technology is advanced, but using it is quite simple. First, the iPad is secured into a hard-shell case equipped with a powerful magnet. When the case is attached to a compatible product, another magnet instantly interlocks your MagConnect shell with a receiver, while a precision screw tightens for a secure fit.\nCompatible with iPad Air.",
